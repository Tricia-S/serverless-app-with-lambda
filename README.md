## Project Overview
As a Data Science student with a strong interest in cloud computing, I was eager to explore how serverless technologies can power scalable, real-time applications. Alongside my full-time studies, I took the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of AWS services—especially AWS Lambda—by working on a collaborative project with a team. This project highlights my individual contributions to our team’s hands-on experience with serverless architecture, enabling us to build a fully functional application that efficiently captures and processes customer data at scale.

## Objective
The primary aim was to experiment with AWS Lambda and gain practical skills in serverless architecture while creating something tangible. I challenged myself to build a system that captures, stores, and manages customer data in real-time, with additional functionalities like notifications and image processing—showcasing the power of serverless infrastructure for data management.

## Project Highlights
This project includes:
- **Data Capture**: A custom-built HTML form that captures customer details.
- **Data Storage**: Leveraging DynamoDB to store customer data with a NoSQL structure.
- **Serverless Data Posting**: Using AWS Lambda in combination with API Gateway to process and post data from the HTML form to DynamoDB in real-time.

## Why I Built This
I pursued this project as a way to:
- **Expand My Technical Skills**: I wanted to explore AWS beyond the basics, integrating multiple services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway) to see how they work together in a serverless ecosystem.
- **Learn Through Experimentation**: Rather than following a strict project outline, I allowed myself the freedom to experiment and make incremental improvements, learning from each step along the way.
- **Apply Concepts in Real-World Scenarios**: This project gave me the opportunity to experience the challenges of cloud infrastructure and serverless computing first-hand, broadening my perspective on scalable solutions.

## Key Takeaways
This project taught me:
- **Practical AWS Skills**: Enhanced my understanding of how to set up and optimize AWS services for real-world applications.
- **Problem-Solving**: I encountered and overcame challenges like optimizing Lambda trigger events and fine-tuning API Gateway integrations.
- **Growth Mindset**: Self-driven learning allowed me to expand my technical repertoire and gain valuable skills in cloud technologies—valuable for my data science career and beyond.

## Future Steps
I plan to continue refining this project by:
- Adding **CloudWatch monitoring** for more detailed performance insights.
- Exploring **Automated Notifications** to configure SNS notifications to alert upon data entry or file uploads.
